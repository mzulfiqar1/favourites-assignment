      Murree is a city located in northern Pakistan. Visiting Murree was my
      first time seeing snow. The experience was great as the locals were
      extremely friendly and the view of the mountains from the chairlift was
      ethereal.

      This is a sport that many do not consider a sport as it appears to be done
      with ease. However, athletes must train their muscles as well as minds for
      high-pressure competitions. Case in point, a false start can cause a
      disqualification and ruin years of work. I enjoy both watching and running
      track. Below are some reasons why you should start running in races:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great for cardiovascular health</li>
      <li>Brightens mood and inspires productivity</li>
      <li>Gives incentive to eat and live healthy</li>
      <li>Make friends with similar goals to you</li>
    </ul>

      Solving puzzles is an underrated hobby. Not only is it a fantastic
      alternative to scrolling on our screens, but it also develops our
      problem-solving and other cognitive skills. It's especially fun to solve a
      puzzle of an intriguing image. As well, it is a soothing activity for the
      mind.
